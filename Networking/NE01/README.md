# NE01 (100 pts)

## Description
There is a TCP network service running on cfta-ne01.allyourbases.co. Find it to get the flag after you connect. Note: The target has many open ports - only one is the correct one. The correct port will identify itself with ID: ne01 after you connect.

## Approach
Since we're scanning for ports, we can use nmap to find the tcp one.
