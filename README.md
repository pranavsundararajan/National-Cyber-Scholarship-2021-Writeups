# NCLCTF-Spring-2021-Writeup
Here are my writeups for the 2021 National Cyber Scholarship competition! Although I didn't solve every challenge, I got through a good portion and wanted to share how I did them. I didn't get to Crypto at all during the competition (yikes), so I'll be working through those and updating them as I solve them in the Practice Arena. I also didn't do too much Web, partly because I was more focused on Binary and Forensics, so again I'll be working on solving those in the Practice Arena.
