# CM01 (250 pts)

## Description
Download the file and find a way to get the flag.

## Approach
When we unzip the [file](cm01.zip), we get 2 images, one which seems to be a functional QR code and the other which is distorded. Scanning the first one, we get `Hey, I've put the flag into the other file using the same trick we always use. You know what to do. :)
